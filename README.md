# Remove Duplicated From Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

# Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).


# Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Solution: 
We wil use the Two Pointers starting from the same end. Notice that we can take advantage of the sorted array and detect duplicates using just pointers. However, if the array was not sorted , we would need to utilize a Hash Map or Bit Manipulation. 
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int j=1;
        int i=0;
        for(i=1;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i] > nums[i-1]){
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
            else{
                continue;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
};

Explanation
Initialization: We initialize two pointers, j and i. Pointer j is set to 1, which will track the position of the next unique element. Pointer i is set to 0 to start traversing the array from the second element.
Traversal: We use a for loop to traverse the array starting from index 1.
Comparison: For each element in the array, we compare it with the previous element. If the current element (nums[i]) is greater than the previous element (nums[i - 1]), it means the current element is unique.
Updating Unique Elements: If the element is unique, we assign it to the position indicated by pointer j (nums[j] = nums[i]), and then increment j to point to the next position.
Skipping Duplicates: If the current element is not greater than the previous element, it means it is a duplicate, and we skip it by continuing the loop.
Return Value: After the loop completes, the value of j will be the new length of the array with unique elements.
This approach ensures that we only use constant extra space, as we are modifying the array in-place, and it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. This efficient use of the two pointers technique helps in solving the problem optimally.
2. Remove Duplicated from Sorted ||
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() < 3){return nums.size();}


        int j =2;
        for(int i=2;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i] != nums[j-2]){
                nums[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
};

Explanation: 
Solution Approach:
To solve this problem efficiently, we can build upon the approach used for the earlier problem where duplicates were allowed without any restrictions. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:
Initialization:
We start with two pointers: j and i, both initialized to 2. The pointer j will track the index where the next valid element (that adheres to the constraint of at most two occurrences) should be placed.
The pointer i traverses through the array starting from index 2, as the first two elements are inherently valid in any scenario.
Iteration:
Traverse the array with pointer i. For each element nums[i], compare it with the element nums[j-2] (which represents the last element that is valid according to the constraint).
If nums[i] is different from nums[j-2], it means we have encountered a new element (or a valid occurrence after the second occurrence), so we can safely place it in nums[j].
Increment j after placing the valid element to prepare for the next position.
Result:
After completing the traversal, j will represent the length of the modified array, as all elements up to j-1 are valid and meet the criteria.
Return j as the final length of the array.
Similarity to Part 1:
This problem is an extension of the earlier problem where duplicates were allowed without any constraints. In both cases:
We use a two-pointer approach (i and j) to traverse through the array and maintain the validity of elements.
The key difference lies in the additional constraint of allowing at most two occurrences for each unique element in this problem.

3. Move Zeroes
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
Solution: 

class Solution {
public:
void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
    for (int lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0, cur = 0; cur < nums.size(); cur++) {
        if (nums[cur] != 0) {
            swap(nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt++], nums[cur]);
        }
    }
}
};


Explanation: 
Initialization: We initialize two pointers, lastNonZeroFoundAt and cur. Pointer lastNonZeroFoundAt is set to 0 and will track the position of the last non-zero element found. Pointer cur is also set to 0 and is used to traverse the array.
Traversal: We use a for loop to traverse the array with the cur pointer from the beginning to the end of the array.
Check for Non-Zero Elements: For each element in the array, we check if it is not zero (nums[cur] != 0).
Swapping Non-Zero Elements: If the current element is not zero, we swap it with the element at the lastNonZeroFoundAt position (swap(nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt++], nums[cur])). After the swap, we increment the lastNonZeroFoundAt pointer to the next position.
Skip Zero Elements: If the current element is zero, we simply continue to the next element in the loop.
This approach ensures that all non-zero elements are moved to the beginning of the array while maintaining their relative order. All zero elements are moved to the end of the array. This solution operates in-place with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, and uses constant extra space.
4. Merge Sorted Arrays

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. The task is to merge nums1 and nums2 into a single sorted array in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should be stored inside nums1.
To accommodate the merge, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements to be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
Examples
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m = 3, nums2 = [2, 5, 6], n = 3
Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1, 2, 3] and [2, 5, 6]. The result of the merge is [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6].
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and []. The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1]. The result of the merge is [1]. Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

Solution
The most Straight forward approach to this problem would be to simply Merge the two array and sort them later with a Nlog(N) complexity.
We can solve this problem using a two-pointer approach. Hereâ€™s the explanation of the provided solution:
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
      
        vector<int> nums1Copy(nums1.begin(), nums1.begin() + m);
       
        int p1 = 0;
        int p2 = 0;
       
        for (int p = 0; p < m + n; p++) {
                       
            if (p2 >= n || (p1 < m && nums1Copy[p1] < nums2[p2])) {
                nums1[p] = nums1Copy[p1++];
            } else {
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2++];
            }
        }
    }
};



Explanation
Copy Elements: First, we make a copy of the first m elements of nums1 into nums1Copy. This allows us to overwrite nums1 while still having access to its original elements.
Initialize Pointers: We initialize two pointers, p1 and p2, to traverse nums1Copy and nums2 respectively.
Merge Process: We use a for loop to iterate through the combined length of nums1 and nums2. In each iteration, we compare the current elements pointed to by p1 and p2:
If p1 has not reached the end of nums1Copy and the current element in nums1Copy is less than the current element in nums2, we assign the value of nums1Copy[p1] to nums1[p] and increment p1.
Otherwise, we assign the value of nums2[p2] to nums1[p] and increment p2.
Boundary Checks: We ensure that the pointers do not exceed the boundaries of their respective arrays during the comparisons.
This approach ensures that the merged array is sorted in non-decreasing order and is stored inside nums1 in-place. The solution operates in O(m + n) time complexity and uses O(m) extra space for the copy of nums1.
5. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.
Example
Example 1:
Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The vertical lines are represented by the array [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]. The container that can contain the most water is formed by the lines at indices 1 and 8, with heights 8 and 7, respectively. The max area of water the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:
Input: height = [1, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The container formed by the lines at indices 0 and 1 can contain 1 unit of water.
Solution Explanation
We can solve this problem using the two pointers technique. Here's an explanation of the provided solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int begin = 0;
        int end = height.size()-1;
        int maxArea = 0;


        std::cout << height.at(end);
        for(;begin<end;){
            int area = min(height[begin], height[end]) * (end - begin);
            maxArea = max(area, maxArea);


            if(height[end] <= height[begin]){
                end--;
            }
            else{
                begin++;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
};



Explanation
Initialization: We initialize two pointers, begin and end. The begin pointer is set to the start of the array, and the end pointer is set to the end of the array. We also initialize maxArea to store the maximum area found.
Traversal: We use a while loop to traverse the array with the two pointers. The loop continues until the begin pointer is less than the end pointer.
Calculate Area: For each pair of lines pointed to by begin and end, we calculate the area formed by the container they make with the x-axis. The area is given by the minimum of the heights of the two lines multiplied by the distance between them (min(height[begin], height[end]) * (end - begin)).
Update Max Area: We update maxArea if the calculated area is greater than the current maxArea.
Move Pointers: To potentially find a larger area, we move the pointer pointing to the shorter line towards the center:
If the line at end is shorter or equal in height to the line at begin, we decrement the end pointer.
Otherwise, we increment the begin pointer.
This approach ensures that we efficiently explore potential containers while maintaining an O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array. This is achieved by leveraging the two pointers technique to minimize unnecessary comparisons.
6. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice. Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example
Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2, 3, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1, 0], target = -1
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
Solution 
We can solve this problem using the two pointers technique. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the provided solution:


class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = numbers.size() - 1;
        vector<int> res;


        for(;lo<hi;){
            if((numbers[lo] + numbers[hi]) < target){
                lo++;
            }
            else if((numbers[lo] + numbers[hi]) > target){
                hi--;
            }
            else{
                res = {lo+1, hi+1};
                break;
            }


        }
        return res;
    }
};



Explanation
Initialization: We initialize two pointers, lo and hi. The lo pointer is set to the start of the array, and the hi pointer is set to the end of the array.

Traversal: We use a while loop to traverse the array with the two pointers until lo is less than hi.

Calculate Sum: For each pair of elements pointed to by lo and hi, we calculate their sum:

If the sum is less than the target, we move the lo pointer to the right to increase the sum.
If the sum is greater than the target, we move the hi pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
If the sum is equal to the target, we have found the two numbers, so we store their 1-indexed positions in the result array res and break the loop.

Return Result: The result array res containing the indices of the two numbers is returned.

This approach ensures that we find the two numbers that sum to the target using O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space. This efficiency is achieved by leveraging the sorted order of the array and the two pointers technique.
7. 3Sum
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
Example
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0, 1, 1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0, 0, 0]
Output: [[0, 0, 0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
Solution 
We can solve this problem using the two pointers technique similar to the previous problem. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the provided solution:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size() && nums[i] <=0; i++){
            if(i == 0 || nums[i-1] != nums[i]){
                twosum(nums, i, res);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }


    void twosum(vector<int>& nums, int i, vector<vector<int>>& res){
        int lo = i+1;
        int hi = nums.size()-1;
        while(lo < hi){
            if(nums[lo] + nums[hi] + nums[i] < 0){
                lo++;
            }
            else if(nums[lo] + nums[hi] + nums[i] > 0){
                hi--;
            }
            else{
                res.push_back({nums[i], nums[lo++], nums[hi--]});
                while (lo < hi && nums[lo] == nums[lo - 1]) ++lo;
        }
        }
    }
};




Explanation
Sorting: First, we sort the array to facilitate the two pointers technique and to easily skip duplicates.

Traverse the Array: We traverse the array using a for loop. For each element nums[i], we set two pointers: lo to i + 1 and hi to the end of the array.

Avoid Duplicates: We skip duplicate elements to avoid duplicate triplets. This is done by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one.

Two Pointers Technique:

We calculate the sum of the current element nums[i] and the elements at the lo and hi pointers.
If the sum is zero, we add the triplet to the result.
We then move the lo pointer to the right, skipping duplicate elements, and similarly, move the hi pointer to the left, skipping duplicates.
If the sum is less than zero, we move the lo pointer to the right to increase the sum.
If the sum is greater than zero, we move the hi pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
This approach ensures that we find all unique triplets that sum to zero with a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the array.

Relationship to the Previous Problem
The 3Sum problem is very similar to the Two Sum II problem in the following ways:

Two Pointers Technique: Both problems use the two pointers technique to find the required elements. In Two Sum II, we use two pointers to find two elements that sum up to the target. In 3Sum, we use two pointers to find two elements that, together with the current element, sum up to zero.

Sorting: Both problems benefit from sorting the array first, which helps in efficiently finding the elements and avoiding duplicates.

Avoiding Duplicates: Both problems include mechanisms to avoid counting duplicate solutions. In Two Sum II, this is simpler since we only need to avoid using the same element twice. In 3Sum, we skip over duplicate elements during the traversal to ensure unique triplets.

By understanding and implementing the two pointers technique, you can efficiently solve both of these problems with optimal time and space complexity.

8. Sort Colors
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. We use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the colors red, white, and blue, respectively.

Example

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 1, 2]

Constraints
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

Solution 
We can solve this problem using the Dutch National Flag algorithm by Edsger W. Dijkstra, which involves a single pass through the array with three pointers. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the provided solution:

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
         int lo = 0;
         int hi = nums.size() - 1;
         int curr = 0;


         for(;curr<=hi;){
            if(nums[curr] == 0){
                swap(nums[lo++], nums[curr++]);
            }
            else if(nums[curr] == 2){
                swap(nums[hi--], nums[curr]);
            }
            else curr++;
         }
    }
};


Explanation
Initialization: We initialize three pointers: lo, hi, and curr.
lo is set to the start of the array and is used to place 0s.
hi is set to the end of the array and is used to place 2s.
curr is used to traverse the array.
Traversal: We use a while loop to traverse the array with the curr pointer until it surpasses hi.
Placing 0s:
If nums[curr] is 0, we swap it with the element at the lo pointer and increment both lo and curr.
This ensures that all 0s are moved to the beginning of the array.
Placing 2s:
If nums[curr] is 2, we swap it with the element at the hi pointer and decrement hi.
We do not increment curr here because the element swapped from the end needs to be checked.
Skipping 1s:
If nums[curr] is 1, we simply move curr to the next position.
This approach ensures that the array is sorted in one pass with constant extra space, making it highly efficient. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is O(1).

9. Remove Element
Problem Statement:

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. After removing the elements, return the number of remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
Output: 2 // nums = [2, 2], the remaining elements are 2 and 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2], val = 2
Output: 5 // nums = [0, 1, 3, 0, 4], the remaining elements are 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100

Solution: 

class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int j = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i] != val){
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
};



Explanation:

Initialization: We initialize j to 0, which will track the index where valid (non-val) elements should be placed in nums.

Iterate: We loop through each element of the vector nums.

Condition check: For each element nums[i], we check if it is not equal to val.

Replacing elements: If nums[i] is not equal to val, we assign nums[i] to nums[j] and then increment j. This effectively "removes" val from the sequence by overwriting it with subsequent non-val elements.

Returning the new length: Finally, we return j, which now represents the new length of nums after removing all occurrences of val.

Note: This approach operates in-place with O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in nums. It efficiently rearranges the array and computes the length of the resulting array without requiring extra space.

10. Rotate Array

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]




Solution: 

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<int> a(nums.size());
        for(int i = 0;i< a.size();i++){
            a[(i + k) % a.size()] = nums[i];
        }
        int j = 0;
        for(int i : a){
            nums[j] = i;
            j++;
        }
    }
};


Explanation: 
Initialization:
Create a temporary array a of the same size as nums to hold the rotated values.
Rotation Logic:
Iterate through each element nums[i] using the index i.
Compute the new index in the rotated array a using (i + k) % a.size(). This formula calculates where each element in nums should be placed in the rotated array a.
Copying to Original Array:
After computing the rotated positions in a, copy each element back from a to nums using a separate loop. This step ensures that the original array nums reflects the rotated state.


11. Next Permutaion
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
Solution: 

class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = nums.size() - 2;
        while(i >=0 && nums[i+1] <= nums[i]){
            i--;
        }
        if(i >= 0){
            int j = nums.size()-1;
            while(nums[j]  <= nums[i]){
                j--;
            }
               int temp = nums[j];
               nums[j] = nums[i];
               nums[i] = temp;


        }
     
   
     reverse(nums.begin() + i + 1, nums.end());
    }
};




Explanation: 

Finding the Pivot:
Start from the right end of the array (nums.size() - 2) and move leftwards (i--) to find the first element (nums[i]) that is smaller than its next element (nums[i+1]). This identifies the pivot where a change needs to be made to get the next permutation.
Finding the Swap Point:
Once the pivot (i) is identified, find the smallest element to the right of nums[i] that is larger than nums[i]. This element (nums[j]) will be swapped with nums[i] to ensure the next permutation.
Swapping:
Swap nums[i] with nums[j] to achieve the next permutation.
Reversing the Remaining Sequence:
After swapping, reverse the sequence of elements to the right of nums[i] (from i+1 to the end of the array). This step ensures that the sequence remains in ascending order, making it the smallest possible permutation after the original order.
12. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.


Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Solution: 

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = numbers.size() - 1;
        vector<int> res;


        for(;lo<hi;){
            if((numbers[lo] + numbers[hi]) < target){
                lo++;
            }
            else if((numbers[lo] + numbers[hi]) > target){
                hi--;
            }
            else{
                res = {lo+1, hi+1};
                break;
            }


        }
        return res;
    }
};




Explanation: 

Initialization:
Initialize two pointers, lo (pointing to the beginning of the array) and hi (pointing to the end of the array).
Two Pointer Technique:
Use a while loop to iterate until lo is less than hi. This loop efficiently narrows down the possible pairs of numbers that could sum up to the target.
Comparison:
Inside the loop, check if the sum of numbers[lo] and numbers[hi] is less than the target. If it is, increment lo to move to a larger number that might make the sum closer to the target.
If the sum is greater than the target, decrement hi to move to a smaller number.
If the sum equals the target, store lo + 1 and hi + 1 (adjusted for 1-based index as per the problem requirements) in the res vector and break out of the loop.
Return Result:
After exiting the loop, return res, which contains the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.
13. Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Solution: 

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i =0;
        int j =0;


        while(i < t.length() && j < s.length())
        {
            if(s[j] == t[i]){
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            else{
                i++;
            }
        }
        if(j == s.length()){return true;}
        return false;
    }
};

Explanation: 

Initialization:
Initialize two pointers, i for iterating through t (potential supersequence) and j for iterating through s (subsequence to check).
Two-Pointer Technique:
Use a while loop that continues as long as both i and j are within their respective bounds (i < t.length() and j < s.length()).
Within the loop:
Compare characters s[j] (current character of the subsequence) and t[i] (current character of the potential supersequence).
If they match (s[j] == t[i]), move both pointers forward (j++ and i++), indicating that the current character in s has been found in t.
If they do not match, only move the pointer i forward (i++), as s[j] hasn't been found yet in t.
Completion Check:
After exiting the loop, check if j has reached the end of s (j == s.length()). If true, it means all characters of s have been found in order within t, so return true.
If j is not equal to s.length(), return false, indicating that not all characters of s were found in order within t.
Edge Case Handling:
If s is an empty string (s.length() == 0), it is always considered a subsequence of any string t.



16. Valid Panlindrome
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

Solutions:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(string s) {
        int j = s.length() -1;
        int i =0;
        while(i<j){
            while(i < j && !isalnum(s[i])){
                i++;
            }
            while(j > i && !isalnum(s[j])){
                j--;
            }


        if(tolower(s[i]) != tolower(s[j])){
            return false;
        }
        cout << s[i] << " " << s[j] << endl;


        i++;
        j--;
        }


        return true;
    }
};



Explanation:

Initialization:
Initialize two pointers, i starting from the beginning (0) and j starting from the end (s.length() - 1).
Two-Pointer Technique:
Use a while loop that continues as long as i is less than j. This loop compares characters from both ends towards the center of the string.
Character Validation:
Inside the loop, use nested while loops to skip non-alphanumeric characters:
while(i < j && !isalnum(s[i])): Move i rightward until a alphanumeric character is found.
while(j > i && !isalnum(s[j])): Move j leftward until a alphanumeric character is found.
Comparison:
Convert characters to lowercase using tolower() to handle case insensitivity.
Compare s[i] and s[j]. If they are not equal, return false, indicating that s is not a palindrome.
Increment Pointers:
After comparing characters, increment i and decrement j to continue checking towards the center of the string.
Completion:
If the loop completes without finding unequal characters (i >= j), return true, indicating that s is a palindrome.
17. Trapping Rain Water
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        int left_max = 0, right_max = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                height[left] >= left_max ? (left_max = height[left])
                                         : ans += (left_max - height[left]);
                ++left;
            } else {
                height[right] >= right_max ? (right_max = height[right])
                                           : ans += (right_max - height[right]);
                --right;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};



Explanation:
Initialization:
Initialize two pointers, left starting at the beginning of the array (0) and right starting at the end (height.size() - 1).
Initialize ans to accumulate the total amount of water trapped.
Initialize left_max and right_max to track the maximum height encountered from the left and right sides, respectively.
Two-Pointer Technique:
Use a while loop that continues as long as left is less than right.
Within the loop:
Compare the heights of height[left] and height[right].
If height[left] is less than height[right]:
Update left_max to be the maximum of its current value and height[left].
If height[left] is greater than or equal to left_max, it means no water can be trapped at left, so we update left_max.
Otherwise, calculate the amount of water that can be trapped above left and add it to ans.
Move left pointer to the right (++left).
If height[left] is greater than or equal to height[right]:
Update right_max to be the maximum of its current value and height[right].
If height[right] is greater than or equal to right_max, update right_max.
Otherwise, calculate the amount of water that can be trapped above right and add it to ans.
Move right pointer to the left (--right).
Result:
After the loop terminates, ans contains the total amount of water that can be trapped between the bars of the elevation map.
Hope you learned a lot from this guide on mastering the Two Pointer approach. This technique simplifies and optimizes the way you handle array-related problems in coding interviews. By using two pointers to traverse arrays efficiently, you can solve complex problems with greater ease.
